###What is a wireframe?###

A wireframe is like an architectural blueprint for web design. It is a planned layout of where everything on your site will go. It helps you define the information hierarchy of your design and to plan your layout according to how you want your user to process the information.

###What are the benefits of wireframing?###

Wireframing is beneficial because it is very useful in determining how the user interacts with the interface. It also allows the designer to plan the layout without the distractions of colors, font choices, or other design elements. A well built wire frame is useful for a stronger website.

###Did you enjoy wireframing your site?###

Yes I did. I used the website called Cacoo and it was very helpful because it already had existing wireframes that you can edit from. I am excited to use my wireframe and actually create the layout.

###Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?###

I revised my wireframe a bit. I wanted it to be simple and have a typical portfolio type look, so I played around with arrangement in order to achieve it.

###What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?###

During this challenge, I was curious to the rules of wire framing. Do they have to be very detailed? Do you have to have specific labels? But I learned from looking at the examples offered in the "Beginner's Guide to Wireframing" that there are so many different wire frames and you can design them whichever way is helpful for you.

###Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?###

I enjoyed designing the wire frame, although it was a bit tedious!
