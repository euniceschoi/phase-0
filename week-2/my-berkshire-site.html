<!--
-What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
    I really enjoyed applying HTML into creating an actual site. It really helped me practice and test  my knowledge on some basic HTML codes. I think it's always more fun to learn hands-on. I look forward to applying the CSS part to the site.
-How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
    It was not bad at all. The HTML5 Doctor website is very useful, and same goes with just looking the elements up on Google.
-How did you do at keeping to best practice (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
    It helped a lot to organize my work via indentation. It also helped me to write the open and end tags before adding text in between.
-What seems good and bad about HTML?
    HTML is pretty straightforward and flexible. I feel that the codes are simple and easy to pick up.I think one con about HTML could be that it is very tedious.
-What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
    I think the best trick is to just keep practicing. Reading and watching videos may help, but you gain the most memory when you're applying what you've learned. Try to recreate a website or even customize a blog via HTML. Mistakes help you notice which codes are more confusing to you than others.
