<!-- Reflection: In this challenge, the main HTML5 tags that we used were main, section, nav, header, and footer. We also added an <aside> tag in the "older entries" section of our blog since that will be on a side bar. We continue to use section and header a lot since those were common ones for organizing the hierarchy of our blogs. Elements get laid out on a page through a basic skeleton format. First the doctype declaration is done, next the charset, and then the html tag. Then you add the head tag, which contains the title and could even hold the CSS style sheet link. The body comes after, and you can't forget the end tags for html, head, and body tags. Customization comes in when you put sections, nav bars, aside tags, and headers within your body. I actually learned many things about Sublime in this challenge. The snippet function is so useful since it takes away the tedious work of rewriting same codes. I also learned more Sublime shortcuts for adding comment boxes, splitting screens, and even uncommenting, thanks to my guide! I definitely see myself creating more snippets in the future. -->
