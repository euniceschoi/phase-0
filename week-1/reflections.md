## 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

After researching through resources, I focused on meditation, "Time Boxing", and counterintuitive methods. Meditation, which can lead to better focus and memory, comes in several forms. You could focus on your breathing for two minutes or even sew for an hour and that would be meditating. "Time Boxing" is another great productivity method. "Time Boxing" is assigning a period of time to perform work and stopping when the time is up, even if the work is not completed. When the time is up, it is time to evaluate the work progress. I can use this method in Phase 0 by assigning myself 1 hour intervals when working on challenges. This way I can create less stress and give myself time to evaluate on my coding work.

Currently, I manage my time by writing everything I need to get done onto my planner. I find that this strategy works okay, but it's mainly a habit of mine. I could organize my tasks better from most important to least and assign time boxes. My overall plan for Phase 0 time management would be to take everything step by step and assign myself time slots. This way I can be productive while learning to take pauses and evaluate my work. I have also tried out the "Head Space" meditation app and see myself using it for clearing my head.


## 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

The shell acts like a middle man between the command line and the operating system. It is run by the operating system and takes commands from the command line to process for the user. "Bash" is a Unix shell program and is the command line interface that is widely used on Macs.

The most challenging for me was writing out commands involving multiple files or directories. Learning the commands was pretty straightforward, but utilizing them up or down the hierarchy of directories was more challenging. Overall, I was able to use all of the commands successfully. I think the most important commands would be the ones that are useful for big files. For instance, using the * as a wildcard is very useful for matching countless text files.

-pwd :prints working directory that you are currently in

-ls :lists all files and directories in the directory you are currently in

-mv :moves and renames items; can be used to rename a text file

-cd :changes directories

-../ :moves up (typing cd ../ would navigate up a directory)

-touch :creates a new file

-mkdir :creates a new directory

-less :looks at contents in a file

-rmdir :removes a directory

-rm :removes files

-help :gives you a manual on commands
