## 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

After researching through resources, I focused on meditation, "Time Boxing", and counterintuitive methods. Meditation, which can lead to better focus and memory, comes in several forms. You could focus on your breathing for two minutes or even sew for an hour and that would be meditating. "Time Boxing" is another great productivity method. "Time Boxing" is assigning a period of time to perform work and stopping when the time is up, even if the work is not completed. When the time is up, it is time to evaluate the work progress. I can use this method in Phase 0 by assigning myself 1 hour intervals when working on challenges. This way I can create less stress and give myself time to evaluate on my coding work.

Currently, I manage my time by writing everything I need to get done onto my planner. I find that this strategy works okay, but it's mainly a habit of mine. I could organize my tasks better from most important to least and assign time boxes. My overall plan for Phase 0 time management would be to take everything step by step and assign myself time slots. This way I can be productive while learning to take pauses and evaluate my work. I have also tried out the "Head Space" meditation app and see myself using it for clearing my head.


## 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

The shell acts like a middle man between the command line and the operating system. It is run by the operating system and takes commands from the command line to process for the user. "Bash" is a Unix shell program and is the command line interface that is widely used on Macs.

The most challenging for me was writing out commands involving multiple files or directories. Learning the commands was pretty straightforward, but utilizing them up or down the hierarchy of directories was more challenging. Overall, I was able to use all of the commands successfully. I think the most important commands would be the ones that are useful for big files. For instance, using the * as a wildcard is very useful for matching countless text files.


-pwd :prints working directory that you are currently in

-ls :lists all files and directories in the directory you are currently in

-mv :moves and renames items; can be used to rename a text file

-cd :changes directories

-../ :moves up (typing cd ../ would navigate up a directory)

-touch :creates a new file

-mkdir :creates a new directory

-less :looks at contents in a file

-rmdir :removes a directory

-rm :removes files

-help :gives you a manual on commands


## 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

A repository is like a folder and is used to store multiple files. Often times, open source projects are available via repositories and users can "fork" or make a copy of them so that they are able to add changes without affecting the original work. Users can also clone repositories onto their local machine so that they can work directly from their text editor instead of working online. They can then push commits, or snapshots of edits, from their terminal to the online platform to track all revisions of their repository. Here are some easy instructions for creating, forking, and cloning a repository via Github.

1. If you are logged onto Github, you should see a plus sign button on the top right corner. Click this button and click "New repository."
2. Give your repository a name, make it private or public, add a license if you wish, and click "create repository!"
3. To fork a repository, simply open that repository on Github and click on the "fork" button that is on the top right corner. You should now have a copy of that repository in your account.
4. To clone a repository, open the repository on Github and copy the HTTPS clone url that is on the right side of the page.
5. Next, open your terminal and make sure you are in a directory not a repository. Then type: **git clone "URL that you copied"** and hit enter! and you should now have a clone in the directory that you are in!

So far, I have had no struggles  setting up git and GitHub. I've used both before, but reading these articles made me better understand the whole process of forking and cloning, and why they would be useful for projects.
