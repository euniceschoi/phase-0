## 4. Open Source and Repo Setup Reflection

Creating a repository is quite simple. When you are logged onto your Github, you should see a plus sign button on the top right corner. When you hover over this button, it says, "Create new.." Click on it and then click on "New Repository." Name the repository, make it public or private, add a license, and click "Create Repository." There you have it!

When you add a license to your repository, you are creating an open source folder. This means that you are the original creator but anyone can contribute and share your repository. Open Source does not make me feel nervous at all. I think that it allows for a community of people who believe in the project and make it more meaningful and better. Without Open Source, we may not have such optimal software contributed by many people that we have now.

Licenses are important because they allow protection for creators and make sure that creators receive some credit. It grants permissions for others to use your work, but you are not giving away any rights.

This challenged solidified the concept of licenses. I wasn't sure why we were choosing the "MIT License" when creating a repo, but learned that MIT Licenses offer the least restriction and anyone can contribute to your work as long as the work is accompanied by the license.
